# VL53L1X TOF Sensor For ARM-V7 Static Compile

## VL53L1X TOF Example For ARM-V7 With CMakeLists && CLion

### VL53L1X

## Description

The VL53L1 is a state-of-the-art, Time-of-Flight (ToF), laser-ranging, miniature sensor enhancing STMicroelectronics’ FlightSense product family. Housed in a miniature and reflowable package, it integrates a SPAD (single photon avalanche diode) array, physical infrared filters and optics to achieve the best ranging performance in various ambient lighting conditions, with a wide range of cover windows.

Unlike conventional IR sensors, the VL53L1 uses ST’s latest generation direct ToF technology which allows absolute distance measurement whatever the target color and reflectance. It provides accurate ranging above 4 m and can work at fast speeds (60 Hz), which makes it the fastest miniature ToF sensor on the market.

With patented algorithms and ingenious module construction, the VL53L1 is also able to detect different objects within the field-of-view with depth understanding at 60 Hz.

Scene browsing and multi-zone detection is now possible with the VL53L1, thanks to software customizable detection array for quicker “touch-to-focus” or mini depth-map use cases.
